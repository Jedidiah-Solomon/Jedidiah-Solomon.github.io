1. data-num is a custom data attribute in HTML that allows you to store extra information 
on an element that is not tied to its core functionality.

In this case, data-num is used to store the numerical value or operator that 
corresponds to each button. It's then used in the JavaScript code to get the value of the button 
that was clicked, and add it to the value on the calculator screen.

For example, the following HTML button:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-yellow" data-num="*">*</button>

Has a data-num attribute with a value of *, which corresponds to the multiplication operator.
 In the JavaScript code, when this button is clicked, the value of * is
 retrieved from the data-num attribute and added to the calculator screen.

 2.(function(){
This line starts an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). An IIFE is a function that is executed as soon as it's defined. It's used here to create a new scope for our code so that 
variables defined inside the IIFE don't conflict with variables defined outside it.

    let screen = document.querySelector('.screen');
This line uses the document.querySelector() method to find the element in the HTML with a class of screen. 
It assigns this element to the variable screen.

    let buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.btn');
This line uses the document.querySelectorAll() method to find all the elements in the HTML with a class of btn.
 It assigns these elements to the variable buttons.

     let clear = document.querySelector('.btn-clear');
    let equal = document.querySelector('.btn-equal');
These lines use the document.querySelector() method to find the elements in the HTML with classes of btn-clear and btn-equal, respectively. They assign these elements to the variables clear and equal.


    buttons.forEach(function(button) {
        button.addEventListerner('click', function(e) {
            let value = e.target.dataset.num;
            screen.value +=value;
        }) 
    })
This code adds a click event listener to each element in the buttons array. When a button is clicked, it gets the value of the data-num attribute from the clicked button using e.target.dataset.num.
 It then appends this value to the value property of the screen element using screen.value += value;.

     equal.addEventListerner('click', function(e) {
        if(screen.value === '') {
            screen.value = " ";
        }
        else {
            let answer =eval(screen.value);
            screen.value = answer;
        }
    } )

This code adds a click event listener to the equal element. When the equal button is clicked, 
it checks if the screen element's value is empty. If it is, it sets the screen element's value to a single space character. If it's not empty, it evaluates the value of the screen 
element using the eval() function, and sets the screen element's value to the result of the evaluation.

    clear.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
        screen.value = " ";
    })
This code adds a click event listener to the clear element. 
When the clear button is clicked, it sets the screen element's value to a single space character.



})();
This line closes the IIFE started at the beginning of the code. It executes the function immediately.
